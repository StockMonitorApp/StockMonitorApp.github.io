					<h2>We're very sorry...</h2>
					<b>September 5th</b><br/>
					Our users are still unable to use the app. Unfortunately we can't fix it without an app update. Because we're already pretty far with the development of StockMonitor 2, we're pausing the current version until version 2 is finalized. Please be patient we're exited to show you what we've been working on!<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>August 6th</b><br/>
					Many users experiencing errors like "Unknown server error (FlatNetError 2)". We're currently having issues with our servers and do not have a functional system. We're working on fixing the issue.<br/>

				<h1>StockMonitor App</h1>
				<span class="subtitle">
					StockMonitor brings the stock or index you're most interested in to your macOS menu bar. To have an even better sight on your investments you can show the current value of your stake. If the current stock price is higher than your buying price it turns green, when it's lower it turns red. It also shows the trend based on the last price one day before.
